# Get Started

There's no user guide, sorry.

In the meantime see [samples](https://github.com/andriusstank/downhill/tree/master/samples)
directory in the source code repository.

You can find haddock documentation [on hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/downhill).

Also keep in mind that `BVar`, `BackGrad` and all their parts are exposed by the library.
You are encouraged to build variables yourself to add any functions or data types
you need.
