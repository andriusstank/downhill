Graph.hs: transpose graph on new expression representation of expr, term, arg.

transposing edges flips ExprName v dv <-> ExprName dv v.
  keep originial ExprName v dv everywhere and have different type for tranposed graph/edges? though symmetry would be nice
  transpose whole ExprMap somehow, including ExprName? is it type safe?
  ditch v dv from ExprName?
  bidirectional SharedExpr, with both ingoing and outgoing edges?
  construct bidirectional SharedExpr right in builder, no need to rebuild graph later. and NonEmpty edges possible
